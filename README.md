# GradeCalc

This package was built to assist students in quickly calculating their course grades. It provides multiple functions that allow the user to create as many courses as the want and input course categories, category weights, individual assignments and their grades in order to calculate the overall course grade. There is also another function that, considering all assignments have been completed and graded except for the final, allows users to calculate what they would need to receive on their final in order to get their desired grade in the course.

There is a test file provided to show the suggested order to use the functions.
